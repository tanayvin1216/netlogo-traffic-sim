# NetLogo Traffic Simulation

This project is an agent-based traffic simulation built in NetLogo. Cars travel along a single-lane road, obey traffic lights, maintain safe following distances, and record travel metrics.

## Model Behavior
- Cars spawn from the left edge at a configurable rate
- Vehicles stop for red lights within a fixed stopping distance
- Cars decelerate and accelerate smoothly
- Traffic lights use staggered timing to create a green wave

## Metrics
- Average travel time
- Average number of stops per vehicle

## How to Run
1. Open the `.nlogo` file in NetLogo
2. Click `setup`
3. Click `go`
4. Adjust sliders such as `traffic`, `num-lights`, `cycle-length`, and `green-fraction`
